	Abstract = {Almost all process systems are nonlinear in nature. Nonlinear control is traditionally an area of interest in process systems engineering which is of great practical importance. These facts notwithstanding, many process engineers have difficulty with the paradigms and results of modern nonlinear control theory because they lack the mathematical background usually associated with such methods or because of their computational difficulty and small-scale applicability in the general case. Analysis and Control of Nonlinear Process Systems overcomes these barriers. Features: The necessary mathematical preliminaries for readers from a process engineering background. Constant reference to the widely-known finite-dimensional linear time-invariant continuous case as a basis for extension to the nonlinear situation. The most promising theories and analytical methods for nonlinear process control laid out clearly and straightforwardly with exercises to reaffirm the techniques as they are taught. Emphasis on the importance of process knowledge and first-principles-based models in obtaining feasible and effective solutions in particular circumstances from general cases. Illustration of applications with simple examples and case studies. Analysis and Control of Nonlinear Process Systems will interest graduate process engineers wishing to study advanced control methods either with a view to further research or application in industry as well as to academics seeking to move process control courses into more complicated but up-to-date territory. It will also be a great assistance to those in their senior undergraduate years who will form the next generation of industrial process engineers and need unfussy access to the most modern nonlinear control ideas.

The introduced control has three main characteristics: (1) the tracking error is used instead of the estimation error in the weights learning equations, avoiding the requirement of a good behavior estimation of the unknown elements in the nonlinear model, (2) the projection method is suggested to avoid the overfitting in the control law, and (3) the Lyapunov technique is utilized to assure the uniform stability of the tracking and weights errors. The suggested technique is applied in two nonlinear processes: the inverted-car and Furuta pendulums.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, All Rights Reserved. Feed-grindability variations (clinker hardness) in cement grinding circuit affects the product quality and productivity of the cement plant. This investigation proposes a generalized predictive controller for cement grinding circuit that is more robust to feed-grindability variations. The main building block of the proposed controller is a new model for cement grinding circuit that directly relates product quality with elevator current and main drive load. The advantage of the model is that the effect of feed-grindability variations on product quality can be easily observed from the output. To develop such a model, this investigation adapts a data driven modelling approach. Experimental data obtained as measurements from cement grinding circuit in a cement mill located near Chennai, India is used to develop the transfer function model based on least squares approach. The model obtained from data driven modelling is used to design a generalized predictive controller whose objective is to optimize the product quality in the presence of feed-grindability variations without breaching physical and operational limits of the cement grinding circuit. The tuning parameters of the proposed generalized predictive controller is adjusted to meet performance metrics specific to cement industries. Our results show that the proposed controller provides better product quality in the presence of feed-grindability variations than other optimization based controllers such as the linear quadratic regulator.},

After publication of the original Ginn and Company edition, we accumulated a large number of modifications, including corrections of typographical errors and misprints, some minor improvements in clarity and other changes in graphical illustrations as a result of errata accumulated from such sources as students, teachers and other readers. We are happy to have Hemisphere Publishing Corporation continue publication of our book and are grateful for the support and fine reception our colleagues have given it. A. E.B. Y.-C. H. Preface This text is intended for use at the senior-graduate level for uni-versity courses on the analysis and design of dynamic systems and for independent .study by engineers and applied mathematicians. An elementary knowledge of mechanics and ordinary differential equations is presumed. Some acquaintance with matrix algebra and the properties of linear systems is desirable, but the required fa-miliarity can be obtained by studying the two appendices. The book grew out of a set of lecture notes fbr a Harvard University summer school program on optimization of dynamic systems given in 1963. These notes were rewritten and extended for graduate courses given at Harvard from 1963 to 1968 and at M.I.T. in 1g66. The book is concerned with the analysis and design of complicated dynamic systems. Particular emplrasis is placed on determining the "best" way to guide and/or control such systems. Over the past twenty-five years, a great body of knowledge has been built up onthe subject of feedback control systems for linear, time-invariant dynamic systems. This knowledge plays an important role in our technology, and almost every engineering school recognizes this fact by teaching courses in this area. However, many dynamic systems -such as aero-space systems -are nonlinear and/or time-varying, and the techniques fbr analysis and design of linear, time-invariant systems are, in gen-eral, not applicable to these more complicated systems. The appealrance of practical, high-speed digital computers in the 1950's provided an essential tool for dealing with nonlinear ancl time-varying systems. Engineers were quick to take advantage of these remarkable computers to do extensive cut-and-try design work on paper instead of in the development laboratory. ln many instances, particularly when designing guidance and control systems, it became clear that a more systematic approach was desirable. This led to a renewed interest in an old subject, the calculus of oari,ations, and to Preface},

	Abstract = {More than 15 years after model predictive control (MPC) appeared in industry as an effective means to deal with multivariable constrained control problems, a theoretical basis for this technique has started to emerge. The issues of feasibility of the on-line optimization, stability and performance are largely understood for systems described by linear models. Much progress has been made on these issues for non-linear systems but for practical applications many questions remain, including the reliability and efficiency of the on-line computation scheme. To deal with model uncertainty `rigorously' an involved dynamic programming problem must be solved. The approximation techniques proposed for this purpose are largely at a conceptual stage. Among the broader research needs the following areas are identified: multivariable system identification, performance monitoring and diagnostics, non-linear state estimation, and batch system control. Many practical problems like control objective prioritization and symptom-aided diagnosis can be integrated systematically and effectively into the {\{}MPC{\}} framework by expanding the problem formulation to include integer variables yielding a mixed-integer quadratic or linear program. Efficient techniques for solving these problems are becoming available. },

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Engineers Australia. This paper presents a systematic design procedure for obtaining a model predictive controller (MPC), encompassed within standard MPC formulations for constrained linear systems to achieve desired output transient responses. The proposed formulation provides a way of overcoming the complexity involved in tuning MPC controllers to accomplish certain output response characteristics. Exponential envelopes are introduced and the outputs are constrained to remain within the envelopes forming the key tuning parameters in meeting the time domain specifications. The key feature of this controller compared to the standard MPC controllers, is the reduced number of effective tuning parameters.

	Abstract = {Three-term or PID regulators are deservedly popular in industrial control systems. They give satisfactory performance for a wide class of processes, they are readily understood by technical plant personnel, and they are easy to implement using analogue or digital hardware. Stable elimination of offset due to load-disturbances is a principal control requirement, as in many cases processes are operated continuously at a fixed set-point Often this is achieved by the PI terms alone, though derivative action can be added for plant with excessive phase lag. In practice, however, nonlinear behaviour such as actuator saturation is a critical component of overall performance. This report discusses various forms of the PID regulator (positional, incremental, cascade, etc) and their closed-loop properties. Practical features such as avoidance of 'integral windup' and 'derivative kick' are described. The ways in which the PID algorithm can be discretised for use in a digital computer are outlined, together with appropriate Fortran coding. The effect of choice of sample interval on the discretised performance is analysed. Often the interval is chosen to be as short as possible given the computational power available; the influence of this on quantisation noise and offset is discussed Various filters are used in a discrete PID algorithm, including the anti-aliasing filter and a filter on derivative action. The properties of these filters are investigated and some interesting nonlinear filters, such as 'spike' filters are presented .},

The procedure of applying the method consists of (1) sampling a process response to a test input signal, (2) processing the sampled data for estimating characteristic values of the process, and (3) calculating the optimal values of the PID control parameters. For the optimization, a new type of performance index, i.e. a weighted integral of squared error is introduced. The procedure is implemented on a digital controller using microprocessors and applied to some real processes, yielding satisfactory results. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

	Abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has a long history in the field of control en- gineering. It is one of the few areas that has received on-going interest from researchers in both the industrial and academic communities. Four major as- pects of model predictive control make the design methodology attractive to both practitioners and academics. The first aspect is the design formulation, which uses a completely multivariable system framework where the perfor- mance parameters of the multivariable control system are related to the engi- neering aspects of the system; hence, they can be understood and `tuned' by engineers. The second aspect is the ability of the method to handle both `soft' constraints and hard constraints in a multivariable control framework. This is particularly attractive to industry where tight profit margins and limits on the process operation are inevitably present. The third aspect is the ability to perform on-line process optimization. The fourth aspect is the simplicity of the design framework in handling all these complex issues. This book gives an introduction to model predictive control, and recent developments in design and implementation. Beginning with an overview of the field, the book will systematically cover topics in receding horizon con- trol, MPC design formulations, constrained control, Laguerre-function-based predictive control, predictive control using exponential data weighting, refor- mulation of classical predictive control, tuning of predictive control, as well as simulation and implementation using MATLAB and SIMULINK as a platform. Both continuous-time and discrete-time model predictive control is presented in a similar framework.},

We obtain a Kalman-like observer to the extent that it relies on the uniform complete observability property specific to LTV systems and can be used to handle the estimation of state-affine systems. However, it does not require the complete uniform controllability property like the Kalman observer does. Like any other state observer it can be used for parameter estimation if the eventual unknown parameters are turned into state variables. This use of the observer is illustrated through an example of state and parameter estimation in the case of an AC machine.},

	abstract = {A design method for PID controllers based on the direct synthesis approach and specification of the desired closed-loop transfer function for disturbances is proposed. Analytical expressions for PID controllers are derived for several common types of process models, including first-order and second-order plus time delay models and an integrator plus time delay model. Although the controllers are designed for disturbance rejection, the set-point responses are usually satisfactory and can be tuned independently via a set-point weighting factor. Nine simulation examples demonstrate that the proposed design method results in very good control for a wide variety of processes including those with integrating and/or nonminimum phase characteristics. The simulations show that the proposed design method provides better disturbance rejection than the standard direct synthesis and internal model control methods when the controllers are tuned to have the same degree of robustness.},
